            <p>My first day of the trip! &nbsp&nbsp I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. &nbsp&nbsp Because I'm on a Segway I won't be able to bring a whole lot with me: &nbsp
            cell phone, &nbsp iPod, digital camera and a protein bar. &nbsp&nbsp Just the essentials. &nbsp&nbsp As Lao Tzu would have said, &nbsp <q>A journey of a thousand miles begines with one step Segway</q>.</p>

            <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: &nbsp <blockquote>Passing cars,<br/> When you can't see, <br/> May get you a glimpse,<br/> Of Eternity.</blockquote>I definitely won't be passing any cars. <img src="img\smiley.jpg" alt=":-)" /></p>

            <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, &nbsp and I passed through some interesting places on the way: &nbsp Walla Walla, &nbsp WA, &nbsp Magic City, &nbsp ID, &nbsp Bountiful, &nbsp UT, &nbsp Last Chance, &nbsp CO, &nbsp Why, &nbsp AZ,
            &nbsp and Trust or Consequences, &nbsp NM.</p>
